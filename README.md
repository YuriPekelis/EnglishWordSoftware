# EnglishWordSoftware
This software is developed for people who are learning English.
You can add your own words and test if you know them. There are 2 vocabularies: for testing words and for already learnt words. 
Every word has the parameter 'tries for knowing' (after addind it is '10'). When it is equal '0' the word will be replaced to the second vocabulary. 
A successfull try decreases this parameter, but mistaken one increases it.
A Translation and a word shows randomly if corresponding option was chosen earlier.
